## Simple AngularJS Runner Info App

This is a yeoman based angular application. So, if you want to work with this you will want to first install yeoman (http://yeoman.io). Once that's done and working to develop on this simply do the following.

1. Clone this repo: git clone git@github.com:DeanPoulin/run-info.git
2. cd into run-info: cd run-info
3. initialize bower and npm: npm install && bower install
4. to run for development: grunt server
5. to create a deployment run: grunt
6. To deploy the new package simply copy the dist directory created from step 5 to the server.
